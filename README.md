# ecommerce-microservices-platform
An e-commerce platform built with Java and Spring Boot, featuring microservices architecture. This project includes user registration, product catalog management, shopping cart functionality, and order processing. It focuses on REST APIs, SQL databases, security, and scalability for mastering backend development.

Step-by-Step Project Plan
1. Define Project Requirements
User Stories:
User registration and login.
View products, add to cart, and place orders.
Admin panel for product and user management.
Functional Requirements:
User authentication and authorization.
Product catalog with categories, descriptions, and stock status.
Shopping cart and order processing system.
Non-functional Requirements:
Secure API endpoints.
Scalable architecture using microservices.
Resilience to failure and fault tolerance.
2. Plan Microservices
Break the monolithic application into independent services. Each service will have its own responsibility, and they should communicate via REST APIs.

User Service: Manages user registration, login, authentication, and user roles.
Product Service: Manages product catalog, inventory, and product details.
Shopping Cart Service: Manages user shopping carts, adding/removing products.
Order Service: Handles order placement, order history, and payment processing.
Payment Service: Simulates payment transactions.
Admin Service: Allows admin users to manage products and view orders.
3. Setup Development Environment
Java: Install JDK (v17 or latest LTS).
Spring Boot: Install necessary dependencies using Maven/Gradle.
Database: Install MySQL or PostgreSQL for relational data storage.
Postman/Swagger: Use to test your APIs.
Docker: Use for containerization (optional but good for deploying microservices).
4. Design the Database Schema
Define the database models for each microservice. Hereâ€™s a sample structure:

User Service DB:
User: UserID, Username, Password (hashed), Email, Role (ADMIN/USER)
Product Service DB:
Product: ProductID, Name, Description, Price, Category, StockQuantity
Shopping Cart DB:
Cart: CartID, UserID, List of ProductIDs, Quantities
Order Service DB:
Order: OrderID, UserID, List of ProductIDs, Quantities, TotalPrice, OrderStatus
Payment Service DB:
Payment: PaymentID, OrderID, Amount, Status (Pending, Completed)
Roadmap for Project Completion
Phase 1: Initial Setup and User Management
Week 1: Spring Boot Setup and User Service
Create a basic Spring Boot application.
Implement User Service with CRUD operations for user registration and login.
Use Spring Security for password encryption.
Implement JWT for authentication and authorization.
Test endpoints using Postman (Register, Login, Get User).
Phase 2: Product Catalog and Shopping Cart
Week 2: Product Service

Implement Product Service with CRUD operations.
Create a product listing endpoint (pagination, filters by category).
Develop endpoints for Admin CRUD operations (add/edit/delete products).
Store data in a relational DB using JPA (MySQL/PostgreSQL).
Implement a basic API documentation with Swagger.
Week 3: Shopping Cart Service

Implement the Shopping Cart Service where users can add/remove products.
Maintain cart status in the database.
Implement validation (e.g., check stock availability).
Create APIs to handle adding/removing products from the cart.
Phase 3: Order Management and Payment
Week 4: Order Service

Implement the Order Service to handle user orders.
Create APIs to place an order, view order history, and cancel an order.
Integrate with the Shopping Cart Service to get cart details during checkout.
Update stock quantities in the Product Service upon successful order.
Week 5: Payment Service

Implement Payment Service to simulate payments.
Secure mock payment APIs using Spring Security and implement API validation.
Ensure orders are marked as paid or failed depending on payment status.
Phase 4: Microservices Architecture
Week 6: Service Communication

Setup REST communication between the services using Feign clients or RestTemplate.
Make sure services can call each other for operations like order creation, product stock check, etc.
Implement Eureka (Service Discovery) for dynamic service registration and lookup.
Week 7: API Gateway & Load Balancing

Set up an API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway or Zuul to route requests to different microservices.
Implement Ribbon or Spring Cloud LoadBalancer for client-side load balancing.
Phase 5: Advanced Features and Deployment
Week 8: Circuit Breaker & Resilience

Implement a circuit breaker (using Resilience4j or Hystrix) to handle service failure gracefully.
Set up retries and fallbacks in case a service is down.
Week 9: Monitoring and Logging

Add centralized logging using Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin for tracing requests across microservices.
Use Actuator for health checks and monitoring.
Week 10: Dockerization and Deployment

Dockerize each microservice.
Set up Docker Compose to orchestrate multi-container microservices.
Optionally, deploy to cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure using Kubernetes (optional but valuable for learning).
Summary of Project Plan and Roadmap:
Weeks 1-3: Setup and Core Services (User, Product, Cart)
Weeks 4-5: Advanced Services (Order, Payment)
Weeks 6-7: Service Communication and Resilience
Weeks 8-10: API Gateway, Monitoring, Dockerization

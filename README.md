# ecommerce-microservices-platform
An e-commerce platform built with Java and Spring Boot, featuring microservices architecture. This project includes user registration, product catalog management, shopping cart functionality, and order processing. It focuses on REST APIs, SQL databases, security, and scalability for mastering backend development.

Step-by-Step Project Plan
1. Define Project Requirements
    - User Stories:
      - User registration and login.
      - View products, add to cart, and place orders.
      - Admin panel for product and user management.
    - Functional Requirements:
      - User authentication and authorization.
      - Product catalog with categories, descriptions, and stock status.
      - Shopping cart and order processing system.
    - Non-functional Requirements:
      - Secure API endpoints.
      - Scalable architecture using microservices.
      - Resilience to failure and fault tolerance.

2. Plan Microservices

    Break the monolithic application into independent services. Each service will have its own responsibility, and they should communicate via REST APIs.

    - User Service: Manages user registration, login, authentication, and user roles.
    - Product Service: Manages product catalog, inventory, and product details.
    - Shopping Cart Service: Manages user shopping carts, adding/removing products.
    - Order Service: Handles order placement, order history, and payment processing.
    - Payment Service: Simulates payment transactions.
    - Admin Service: Allows admin users to manage products and view orders.

3. Setup Development Environment

    - Java: Install JDK (v17 or latest LTS).
    - Spring Boot: Install necessary dependencies using Maven/Gradle.
    - Database: Install MySQL or PostgreSQL for relational data storage.
    - Postman/Swagger: Use to test your APIs.
    - Docker: Use for containerization (optional but good for deploying microservices).

4. Design the Database Schema

    Define the database models for each microservice. Hereâ€™s a sample structure:

    - User Service DB:
      - User: UserID, Username, Password (hashed), Email, Role (ADMIN/USER)
    - Product Service DB:
      - Product: ProductID, Name, Description, Price, Category, StockQuantity
    - Shopping Cart DB:
      - Cart: CartID, UserID, List of ProductIDs, Quantities
    - Order Service DB:
      - Order: OrderID, UserID, List of ProductIDs, Quantities, TotalPrice, OrderStatus
    - Payment Service DB:
      - Payment: PaymentID, OrderID, Amount, Status (Pending, Completed)

Summary of Project Plan:

  Weeks 1-3: Setup and Core Services (User, Product, Cart)
  
  Weeks 4-5: Advanced Services (Order, Payment)
  
  Weeks 6-7: Service Communication and Resilience
  
  Weeks 8-10: API Gateway, Monitoring, Dockerization
